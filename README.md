# Caps_alpha_beta_gamma

This is the repository for the work with Wenguan Wang while I was at UCLA, 2017 fall. We aimed to combine the alpha-beta-gamma network with the idea of Capsule by Hinton. However the testing process didn't show any promising results. And this repository is set for any interested researchers who still want to work on this idea.

main.py, model.py are original alpha_beta_gamma files

caps_model.py and routing.py are new files to use capsules in the alpha-beta-gamma network



## TODO
in the caps_model.py, still need to **separate the nodes and concanated the alpha, beta, gamma of the same node and train them together**.
