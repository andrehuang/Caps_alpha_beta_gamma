# Caps_alpha_beta_gamma

main.py, model.py are original alpha_beta_gamma files

caps_model.py and routing.py are new files to use capsules in the alpha-beta-gamma network

## TODO
in the caps_model.py, still need to **separate the nodes and concanated the alpha, beta, gamma of the same node and train them together**.
